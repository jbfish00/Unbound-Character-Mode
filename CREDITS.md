# Character Mode (Unbound) — Art Credits

Character Mode's playable-character sprites are staged from donor sources
via the ROWE Character Mode project (`assets/donor_sprites_staged/`,
`tools/stage_donor_sprites.py`), which itself credits the following games,
decompilation projects, and fan works. Huge thanks to every artist. This mod
is distributed as a patch only, never as a prebuilt ROM.

## Base game / engine

- **Pokémon Unbound** by Skeli789 — the ROM this mod patches.
- **Complete FireRed Upgrade (CFRU)** by Skeli789 and ghoulslash — the open-
  source engine Unbound is built on top of; used here as a structural/shape
  reference during reverse-engineering (not as injected code).
- **Skeli789/Dynamic-Pokemon-Expansion** ("Unbound" branch) — species,
  evolution, and base-stat data tables used to resolve Bulbapedia roster
  names to Unbound's likely internal species ids (provisional pending
  ROM-side verification).
- **pret/pokefirered** decompilation — structural reference for the
  underlying FireRed engine Unbound extends.

## Overworld & trainer sprites (staged via the ROWE project; same original credits apply)

- **pret/pokefirered** — FRLG overworld sprites and trainer fronts for
  Kanto characters.
- **sinnoh-remakes/pokeemerald-platinum** — Gen IV (DPPt) overworld sheets
  and DP trainer fronts (Lucas, Dawn, Cynthia, gym leaders, Elite Four,
  Team Galactic).
- **PokemonHnS-Development/pokemonHnS** — HGSS-style overworld sheets and
  trainer fronts for Johto characters, and HGSS-style walking upgrades for
  the Kanto cast.
- **DiegoWT — "Gen 5 Characters in Gen 4 OW style"**
  (https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/370/) — Unova cast overworld sprites,
  downscaled 0.5x to GBA proportions. Credit required by the resource
  terms; please keep this notice with any redistribution.
- **StreakOfSprites** (https://www.deviantart.com/streakofsprites) — Ash
  Ketchum FRLG-style overworld sprite set.

## Rosters

## Coverage note

96 of 156 characters (Gen 1-5 cast, plus a few Gen 1 anime characters) have
staged donor art. The remaining 60 (Gen 6-8 game-original characters, plus a
handful of anime-only Gen 1-5 characters) have no GBA-style pixel art
anywhere, official or fan-made — per user-confirmed policy, these get a
trainer-card/menu-select portrait only, with a generic/default overworld
costume fallback. See `docs/SPRITE_COVERAGE.md` for the full breakdown.

## Ash Gray donor art (added 2026-07-23)

- **Pokemon Ash Gray** (FireRed hack) by **metapod23** — anime-character
  trainer sprites (Jessie & James duo, Ritchie, Tracey, Duplica, Todd,
  Giselle, A.J., Otoshi, Samurai, Damian, Gary, Orange Islands leaders,
  anime-style Kanto leaders) and Ash player art, staged in
  `sprites/donors/ashgray/`. Ripped from a locally-built copy (BPS patch on
  a source-built clean FireRed). Credit metapod23 in any distribution that
  ships this art.


## Emerald Rogue — trainer, back and overworld sprites (added 2026-07-25)

Staged in `sprites/donors/rogue/` — 294 sprites covering 160 Character Mode
characters (149 trainer front pics, 133 overworld sheets, 12 battle back pics),
filtered from a 531-file harvest down to characters actually on the roster.

- **Source**: https://github.com/Pokabbie/pokeemerald-rogue, branch `vanilla`,
  commit `79c1df5f8a2ebb423c7a48d29de0cf21ef5783e7`, fetched 2026-07-25.
- **Format**: converted from the repo's PNGs by `tools/png_to_gba.py` into
  `.4bpp` + `.gbapal` and LZ77 (BIOS type 0x10) streams of each. Every blob was
  round-tripped through the decompressor before staging.
- **Licensing**: the repository has **no LICENSE file**. Its in-game credits
  roll is the only attribution trail that exists, and it maps no artist to any
  individual file — so the **whole list travels with any subset of the art**.

## Team Aqua's Asset Repo, pokemonHnS, pokeemerald-platinum (added 2026-07-25)

Three more donor sets staged alongside `rogue/`, converted by
`tools/png_to_gba.py` and filtered to characters on the Character Mode roster.

### `sprites/donors/taar/` — 251 sprites, 92 characters
- **Source**: https://github.com/TeamAquasHideout/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo, branch
  `main`, commit `36b619ecd1d2df95212b375c95803af78414f78a`, fetched 2026-07-25.
- **Licence** (repo README, verbatim): *"This is a collection of free to use
  assets that are intended to be used for Generation 3 Pokémon decomp hacking...
  All assets are both free to use and edit by default, but if any assets
  specifically mention not being free to edit, please respect the author's
  wishes... provided they are submitted alongside credit to their original
  creator."*
- **Attribution is per-author and mandatory.** The second path element of every
  upstream file IS the author — `Trainer Back Sprites/yoshord/…` is yoshord's
  work. `harvest_index.json` in the staged directory preserves each file's
  original path, so the author is always recoverable. Named contributors whose
  work is staged here include **yoshord** (Lance back, 64x384 six-frame — his
  README ships the matching `sAnimCmd_Lance_Back[]`), **ShinyDragonHunter**
  (Blue/Gary back, 64x320), **spilledpizza** (Prof. Rowan overworld, Cynthia
  mugshot), **Phantomony** (Archie mugshot), **mudskip** (Phoebe back),
  **Kalarie** (anime front pics), **Ringloom** (HGSS Lyra), **kwenio**, **Lhea**,
  **KyuZee**, **hyo**, **Solo993**.
- Aggregate folders re-credit upstream creators per subfolder — read the
  author's own README before shipping any single sprite.

### `sprites/donors/hns/` — 41 sprites, 30 characters
- **Source**: https://github.com/PokemonHnS-Development/pokemonHnS, branch
  `main`, commit `751823abaf677020bcd72c45fe3e7cb2b8a576e4`.
- HGSS-style 64x64 front pics; covers **Lance, Blue, Misty, Brock**, Red, Karen,
  Clair, Giovanni, Sabrina and the Johto/Kanto leaders and Elite Four.
- **Licence**: no LICENSE file. README, verbatim: *"it's also completely open
  source, and is intended to be a base for a new generation of Johto rom
  hacks"* / *"If you'd like to improve, expand upon, or make your own version of
  HnS, feel free to take advantage of the open source!"*
- **Sprite credit** (flat, no per-file attribution available):
  **Cesare_CBass, AveonTrainer, PurpleZaffre, BatimaTheBat**.

### `sprites/donors/platinum/` — 49 sprites, 36 characters
- **Source**: https://github.com/sinnoh-remakes/pokeemerald-platinum, branch
  `master`, commit `09091ed1d8c07c3353608ac91603ac59ab41fc70`.
- Covers **Cynthia**, **Cyrus**, Dawn, Lucas, Barry, Bertha, Lucian, Volkner,
  Candice, Maylene, Fantina, Roark, Byron, Crasher Wake, Mars/Jupiter/Saturn.
- **⚠️ Weakest attribution of the three.** No LICENSE, no asset licence, and no
  per-sprite attribution at all; the README is the inherited RHH one
  (*"If you use pokeemerald-expansion, please credit RHH (Rom Hacking
  Hideout)."*). It is a fan remake, so some art may be third-party redistributed
  without individual credit. **Prefer the TAAR version of a character where one
  exists with a named author**, and treat this set as the fallback for the
  Sinnoh cast.


## Pokesho, kalarie, LouLilie — anime and rival art (added 2026-07-25)

### `sprites/donors/pokesho/` (27 front pics) and `sprites/donors/pokesho_field/` (19 frames)
- **Source**: ポケしょ / Pokesho, by ポケモア (Pokemore) — http://www.pokesho.com
  **Both galleries are retired from the live site**; retrieved from the Wayback
  Machine capture of **2018-08-15** (bulk archives `img_zip/icon_battle.zip` and
  `img_zip/f_chara.zip`), 2026-07-25.
- **Licence, verbatim from the archived gallery**:
  「GBA風トレーナードット絵を展示しています。**フリー素材になります**。」
  ("GBA-style trainer pixel art is exhibited here. **These are free
  materials.**") and 「すべて64×64サイズ。透明色合わせて最大16色です。
  **素材としての使用も可能です**。」 Site FAQ: 「素材もらってもいいですか！？」→
  「**どうぞどうぞ！！**」 ("May I take the materials!? — **Please, go right
  ahead!!**")
- **Credit as**: 「ポケしょ / Pokesho（ポケモア）」
- **Ethical note kept deliberately**: the permission above was granted while the
  galleries were published, and the author has since retired them, stating he
  removes work he considers lower quality. This art is used on archived
  permission. If he ever asks for it to be withdrawn, honour that.
- `pokesho_field/` is **reference-only** — 16x22 single front-facing frames, not
  tile-aligned and not injectable without someone drawing the side and back
  frames. Staged because it is the only existing GBA-style art for **Paul,
  Zoey, Nando** and a **solo James**. See that directory's README.txt.

### `sprites/donors/kalarie/` — 69 anime overworld sheets
- **Source**: kalarie, PokéCommunity thread 407124 ("Fire Red Overworld Sprite
  Resource"), anime section. 144x32 (one 160x32) nine-frame FireRed NPC sheets.
- **Licence, verbatim**: *"You're free to use any of these sprites in your hack,
  that's the whole purpose of this resource. Be sure to give proper credit
  though."*
- **Credit**: **Kalarie** (all anime sprites); **Pokesho** (various first frames
  — kalarie animated Pokesho's front frames into full sheets, and says so).
- **Technical caveat**: these do not all fit FireRed's default palettes and need
  Navenatox's Dynamic Overworld Palettes patch.
- **Identification caveat**: the sprites are unlabelled at source. Only
  **Misty, Brock, Jessie and James** are confidently matched to roster
  characters; the other 65 are staged honestly as `anime_npc_*` rather than
  guessed at. `CONTACT_SHEET_front_frames.png` is included for a human ID pass.

### `sprites/donors/loulilie/` — 4 sprites
- **Source**: LouLilie, DeviantArt — "FRLG Rival Green as Player" and "FRLG
  Player Blue LGPE Design".
- **Licence, verbatim**: *"Feel free to use in your projects with credit!"*
- **Credit**: **LouLilie**
- Provides a second **Blue/Gary back pic** (64x320, 16 colours) extracted from a
  pixel-perfect 2x sheet, alongside the TAAR/ShinyDragonHunter one. One
  documented judgement call: the five aligned frames span 68px, so the window
  chosen keeps four frames pixel-complete and clips only the tip of a thrown
  Poké Ball leaving frame 4 — which is how FRLG back pics behave anyway.
