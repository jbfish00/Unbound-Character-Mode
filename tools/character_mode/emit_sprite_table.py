"""Pick one trainer front pic per character and emit an injectable sprite table.

Phase 3 wiring. Until now `sprite_asset_id` has been 0xFFFF in every record --
a placeholder for art that did not exist. 754 sprites are now staged under
`sprites/donors/`, so this resolves each character to one of them and emits the
two blobs the injector places:

    cm_sprite_blobs.bin   every chosen sprite's LZ77 gfx + palette, concatenated
    cm_sprite_offsets.bin NUM_CHARACTERS x {u32 gfx_off, u32 pal_off}, relative
                          to the blob base; 0xFFFFFFFF for a character with no art

The injector turns those offsets into absolute ROM pointers, and
`emit_characters.py` writes `sprite_asset_id` = the character's own index (or
0xFFFF), so a reader can go character -> table entry -> gfx/palette in one hop.

Deliberately NOT touching gTrainerFrontPicTable's existing 148 slots. Repointing
those would replace the art of real opponents mid-playthrough; this table is
additive and changes nothing the game already draws. What renders it is a
separate question -- see docs/SPRITE_COVERAGE.md.

Source preference, best first. Rationale rather than taste:
  ashgray   already verbatim ROM-format LZ, and anime-specific art we cannot
            get elsewhere -- but only where it is that character's own pic,
            not an alternate
  rogue     the largest coherent set, one consistent style across Gen 1-9
  taar      per-author attribution is recoverable, the cleanest licence
  hns       HGSS-style, good Kanto/Johto coverage
  pokesho   anime-specific, fills gaps the game-art sets cannot
  platinum  weakest attribution (no per-sprite credit) -- last resort
