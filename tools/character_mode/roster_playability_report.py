"""How much of THIS GAME's own wild data is on each character's roster?

Ported from ROWE's tools/character_mode/roster_playability_report.py
(../../game_plans/rowe_parity.md §0). ROWE reads its encounter tables out of a
decomp JSON; there is no such file here, so this reads them straight out of the
ROM -- see "LOCATING THE TABLE" below.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The playthrough checklist's last irreducible question is
"whether a roster is miserable to play for 40 hours", and it has always been
filed as pure human judgement. Most of it is, but a large part is measurable and
nobody had measured it in this repo.

The playability threshold already guarantees six fully-evolved obtainable
Pokemon, and the 10%% roster override guarantees you MEET your character's
Pokemon at a fixed rate everywhere. Neither answers the question that actually
decides whether a run drags: **when you walk into grass and something appears,
how often is it yours to keep?** That is the map's own encounter tables versus
the character's roster, and it is entirely in the data.

`natural%%` is the share of the game's wild encounter SLOTS whose species is on
that character's roster. It deliberately EXCLUDES the 10%% override, because the
override is the floor every character already has; what separates a comfortable
roster from a miserable one is what happens in the other 90%%.

⚠️ WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a verdict and must never become a gate. A low
score can be entirely fine (a character you play for the set pieces) and a high
one does not make a run fun. It is a flag for "check this one during the
playthrough" -- exactly what the checklist needs and what a suite cannot give.

⚠️ IT COUNTS SLOTS, NOT ENCOUNTER PROBABILITY. Slot 0 of a land table is 20%% of
that map's encounters and slot 11 is 1%%, so a roster that only matches rare
slots scores higher here than it plays. Weighting by the real slot chances is a
worthwhile refinement; it is not done, and this note is here so the number is
not read as more precise than it is. ROWE's version carries the same caveat.

⚠️ NO `early%%`. ROWE also reports the opening routes, using a hand-written list
of its starting maps. This repo has no map-progression data, and inventing one
by taking "the first N table records" would be a guess dressed as a measurement.
The comparable-and-honest signal here is ZERO-COVERAGE characters, reported
below.

LOCATING THE TABLE. gWildMonHeaders is an array of fixed-size records:
    u8 mapGroup; u8 mapNum; u16 pad; then N pointers to WildPokemonInfo
    struct WildPokemonInfo { u8 encounterRate; u8 pad[3]; const WildPokemon *; }
    struct WildPokemon     { u8 minLevel; u8 maxLevel; u16 species; }
terminated by mapGroup == 0xFF. The base, stride and field count below were
found by scanning for that shape and CONFIRMED by decoding the species: a real
table is dominated by Magikarp/Zubat/Tentacool, a false positive is not.

⚠️ THE STRIDE IS NOT THE SAME IN EVERY GAME. The two FireRed-family ports use
the vanilla 20-byte, 4-pointer header. The two Emerald-family ports use a
24-byte, 5-pointer header -- which is why a 20-byte scan finds nothing there at
all. That is corroborated independently by their own Battle Pyramid code, which
indexes its headers with `(i*3)<<3`.
