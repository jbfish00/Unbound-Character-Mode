"""Emit per-character WILD-ENCOUNTER MARKER strings -- marker_strings.bin.

WHY THIS EXISTS (../../game_plans/rowe_parity.md §3). Character Mode's 10%
roster override hands the player a family ROOT, and an override that produces
a family root is INDISTINGUISHABLE from an ordinary encounter the map's own
table could have produced. ROWE measured the consequence: the median selectable
character matches ~2% of the game's own wild slots, so the override is doing
nearly all the work of building a team -- invisibly. Platinum then proved the
failure mode is real rather than theoretical: its first playthrough was reported
as "no on-roster encounters" when there was no bug at all, and naming the
character in the wild intro was the fix.

WHAT THE ENGINE NEEDS. The wild intro is picked in BufferStringBattle, which
loads one of several string pointers into r0 and falls into a single
    BattleStringExpandPlaceholders(src, dst)
call. We retarget that one call and swap `src` for one of these strings.

⚠️ WHY THE STRINGS ARE STATIC, ONE PER CHARACTER, RATHER THAN BUILT AT RUNTIME.
The obvious design is to build "…destined for <NAME>!" in a scratch buffer at
display time -- and this ROM has no RAM of its own to build it in. Seaglass's
legendary feature already had to spend 20 save flags for want of writable RAM.
Emitting one finished string per character costs ~9 KB of otherwise-dead ROM,
needs no buffer, no allocation and no lifetime reasoning, and cannot be
corrupted by anything the engine does to its own text buffers.

The mon's own name still comes from the engine: {FD}{06} is the
B_OPPONENT_MON1_NAME placeholder, copied verbatim out of the original string so
the expander sees exactly what it always saw.

Output: marker_strings.bin, NUM_CHARACTERS x STRIDE bytes, 0xFF-padded.
