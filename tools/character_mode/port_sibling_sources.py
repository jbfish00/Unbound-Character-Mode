"""Port source labels from a sibling repo's roster_sources.json. Gap-fill only.

A source label says WHERE A CHARACTER OWNED a Pokemon -- "Anime — Pokemon
Origins PO01", "Emerald", "Battle Subway". That is an ownership fact about the
character, not a fact about which ROM you are playing, so it ports between
games unchanged. This is the same reasoning `push_rosters.md` records for
reusing wave 5's verdicts across repos ("the verdicts are ownership calls, not
per-game ones") and for copying ROWE's hand-made Frontier Brain labels rather
than re-deriving them (§5).

Radical Red reached 100% coverage by porting ROWE's hand attributions; this
brings the same labels here instead of re-researching them. Provenance is not
laundered: every ported row records `source_ported_from`, and a row that already
carries a source is never overwritten.

Idempotent. Run before emit_roster_docs.py.

Usage: port_sibling_sources.py [--dry-run] [--from PATH_TO_roster_sources.json]
