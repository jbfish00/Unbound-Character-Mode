"""Negative test for the PC-exit sweep checks in verify_artifacts.py.

The twenty checks added for the PC-exit hook (five per site, FOUR sites --
game_plans/rowe_parity.md §13.24/§13.26c) are worth exactly what they FAIL on.
So break the built ROM on purpose, in each direction the hook can be wrong, and
require the matching check to report FAIL BY NAME -- not merely that the run
exits 1, because a tampered ROM also trips the diff-containment check and that
would look like a catch while proving nothing about these twenty.

  1. control                    -- the real build passes all twenty
  2. the goto operand bent      -- the PC script jumps to the wrong tail
  3. the splice reverted        -- the stock tail is back, so the hook is
                                   simply absent while everything else is fine
  4. the sweep special bent     -- the tail runs A special after the waitstate,
                                   just not the sweep. The case a "there is a
                                   special there" test cannot catch.
  5. the sweep moved BEFORE the -- ordering is load-bearing: run before the
     waitstate                     waitstate the sweep sees the party the
                                   player walked IN with, a silent no-op
  6. the CROSS-WIRE             -- site 0's tail rejoins site 1's caller. The
                                   tail stays perfectly well-formed and every
                                   check but the rejoin passes, while the
                                   player is sent into the wrong script on
                                   exit. ⭐ This game has FOUR sites, the most
                                   of any port, so this is the tamper that
                                   matters most here.
  7. the anchor bent            -- the msgbox pointer above the splice no
                                   longer names the PC text, i.e. the script
                                   moved and the splice is now landing on
                                   something else
  8. control again

⚠️ The ROM is never modified in place. Each case writes a tampered COPY to a
temporary directory and points verify_artifacts.py at it with CM_BUILT_ROM. The
base ROM under rom/ and the build under build/ are read-only here.
