"""INVENTORY every scripted gift EGG in this ROM.

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS. Eggs are deliberately exempt from the catch gate, the gift
routing and the party sweep, so an egg event can never block progress. Nothing
then looks at what the egg HATCHES INTO, so a scripted gift egg of an
off-roster species becomes a permanent off-roster party member. Breeding cannot
reach that: a roster stores whole evolution families and only on-roster parents
can be kept, so offspring are on-roster by construction. **Gift eggs are the
way in**, which makes the set of them the thing worth pinning.

⚠️ THE PRIMITIVE, AND THE ONE THAT DOES NOT WORK. The obvious scan -- "every
0x7A byte followed by a plausible species" -- returns thousands of hits in a
32 MB ROM and cannot be filtered down by species range or by decoding forwards;
measured on Radical Red, it gave 3,249 raw candidates and 116 survivors after
pointer-and-decode filtering, of which ZERO were real. Script bytecode is not
word-aligned and is not distinguishable from data by inspection of one command.

What works is decoding from an anchor that data cannot fake cheaply: the byte
pair `0F 00` (loadword into destination 0) followed by a ROM pointer whose
target decodes as Gen 3 text. Every dialogue script in this engine contains
one. From each anchor we decode linearly and follow goto/call/goto_if/call_if,
and record every `giveegg` reached. That is a REACHABILITY claim about the
script graph, not a byte pattern.

⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. It proves the set of `giveegg` commands
reachable from dialogue has not changed. It does NOT prove that set is the
complete set of ways an egg can enter the party: an egg whose species is
computed in native code (a `callnative`, or the Day Care) never appears as a
`giveegg` operand at all. Radical Red's egg vendor dialogue advertises a
"Wonder Egg that just contains a random first form Pokemon" -- the pool behind
that wording is not visible to this scan. The inventory is a floor, not a
ceiling, and it is deliberately a floor on the paths that are cheap to see.
