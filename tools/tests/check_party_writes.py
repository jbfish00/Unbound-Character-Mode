"""INVENTORY every mon-sized copy INTO gPlayerParty in this ROM.

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS A SECOND INVENTORY.

check_acquisition_paths.py pins every writer of gPlayerPartyCount, on the
reasoning that anything handing the player a Pokemon must increment it. That
caught what it was built for -- but reverse-engineering all 42 of those writers
(2026-09-02, docs/PARTY_COUNT_WRITERS.md) showed the commonest shape by far is
a RECOUNT: `count = 0; ++ per non-empty slot`. A recount introduces nothing,
which is why every one is EXEMPT -- and it is also exactly what makes a DIRECT
write into gPlayerParty legitimate afterwards.

So the count byte is a good primitive for catching a routine that ADDS and a
poor one for catching a routine that writes the array and lets a recount bless
it. That is the workspace's lesson #1 -- *an inventory is only as good as its
choice of PRIMITIVE* -- recurring one level UP rather than one idiom over.
This file is the other half.

⚠️ CHOOSING THE PRIMITIVE TOOK THREE TRIES, and the failures are the useful
part:
  1. "every store through a gPlayerParty-derived pointer" -> 261 write
     candidates. Unusable.
  2. "every function called with a gPlayerParty pointer in r0" -> 171 distinct
     callees, because GetMonData(&gPlayerParty[i], ...) passes the mon in r0
     too. A read looks exactly like a write at that resolution.
  3. What works: a call whose destination register is gPlayerParty-derived AND
     whose r2 is the mon size (100). A species can only enter a party
     slot as a whole-mon copy, and the size argument is what separates the
     copies from the reads. 17 sites, 5 distinct callees.

⭐⭐ AND THE PRIMITIVE WAS WRONG IN THREE MORE WAYS, ALL FOUND 2026-09-04
(../game_plans/rowe_parity.md §13.24). Each is written up beside the code
that fixes it, because each is the same lesson in a new costume:

  1. THE SIZE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AN IMMEDIATE. The scan accepted only
     `movs r2,#<mon size>`; a compiler may keep the size in a callee-saved
     register and issue `movs r2, r4`. CFRU's CreateShedinja does, so the extra
     Pokemon a Nincada evolution creates -- a genuine acquisition path, written
     straight into gPlayerParty[count] and blessed by a recount -- was invisible
     in BOTH CFRU games. See size_seed().
  2. r2 == THE MON SIZE IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CALL A COPY.
     `movs r2,#100 ; muls r0,r2` is the party-slot stride multiply and leaves
     r2 holding 100 at the NEXT call, so plain `GetMonData(mon, field, NULL)`
     reads were being inventoried as copies -- two per Emerald game. A copy's
     r1 is a pointer; a field request's r1 is a small immediate.
  3. IN THE CFRU GAMES THE BL TARGET IS A VENEER, not the callee. Everything
     the hack's own high-ROM code calls, it calls through one block of
     `bx r3 / bx r4 / bx r5 / bx r6`. So EXPECT_CALLEES was pinning the veneer,
     and "no new copy primitive is in use" meant only "it still goes through
     the veneer" -- which a call to literally anything satisfies. See
     veneer_reg(); with the register resolved the callee set collapses to the
     real functions (CopyMon, memcpy).

⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. It proves the set of mon-sized
copies into the party has not changed, and that they all go through known copy
primitives. It does NOT prove each one is harmless -- that is what the verdicts
record. It also does not cover a CreateMon-family call that builds a mon in
place; no such site exists in this ROM's inventory today, and a new one would
appear here as a new callee. And it is a scan for ONE shape: the Emerald pair's
PC-withdraw path does not appear here at all, which is a fact about this scan
and not a clean bill of health for the PC (see the UNGATED verdict in the
FireRed pair, and rowe_parity.md §13.24).
