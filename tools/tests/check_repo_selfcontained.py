"""INVENTORY every reference this repo still makes to the unrelated ROWE tree.

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS.

Until 2026-09-02 this repo hardcoded the absolute path
"/home/jbfish00/Documents/Pokemon Rowe Alteration/charmap.txt" in its INJECTOR
and in verify_artifacts.py, so it could not be built or verified at all from a
fresh clone -- the ROM build silently depended on an unrelated project's working
tree existing at one particular absolute path on one particular machine.
rowe_parity.md recorded this as affecting only marker-string regeneration, which
understated it by a lot. The charmap is now VENDORED at tools/charmap.txt and
every consumer resolves it from its own location.

⚠️ This is an INVENTORY, not a grep, for the reason lesson #1 gives: a checker
that greps the files which already contain a fix cannot see a NEW file that
lacks one. So it enumerates every surviving reference repo-wide and demands a
stated reason for each. A newly-introduced hardcoded path is then a FAILING
CHECK rather than a silent arrival.

The surviving references are all cross-repo DONOR tools -- scripts whose whole
job is importing data out of ROWE. Those are legitimately absolute. What must
never come back is a reference on the BUILD or VERIFY path.
