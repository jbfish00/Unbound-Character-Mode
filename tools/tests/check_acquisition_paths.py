"""INVENTORY every routine in this ROM that writes gPlayerPartyCount.

⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is an inventory rather than a grep.

The workspace's lesson #1 (CLAUDE.md, from Platinum): *a checker that greps the
files which ALREADY contain a hook cannot see a bypass in a file with no hook.*
Platinum's acquisition inventory enumerated `Party_AddPokemon*` repo-wide and
still could not see the link trade or the GTS, because a trade fills the slot
its partner vacated and adds nothing. The fix there was not "search more files"
but "choose a different PRIMITIVE to count".

For a GBA binary hack the primitive that cannot be dodged is the one every
acquisition must eventually touch: **the party count byte itself**. A routine
that hands the player a Pokemon has to increment gPlayerPartyCount, whatever
route it took to get there. So this enumerates every instruction in the ROM
that STORES through a pointer to that byte, and requires each one to carry a
verdict below. A new acquisition path is then a failing check rather than a
silent arrival.

✅ THE METHOD IS VALIDATED ON A KNOWN POSITIVE. Run against Seaglass, it
rediscovers both that game's enforcement choke point AND the give-core bypass
its own ROUTINE_MAP documents as "never BLs GiveMonToPlayer -> bypasses the
injected CM gate" -- a path a caller-of-GiveMonToPlayer scan cannot see, and
the exact shape of the Platinum miss.

⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. It proves the SET of party-count writers
has not changed. It does NOT prove each one is correctly gated -- that is what
the verdicts record, and several are still UNVERIFIED (they are writers whose
containing routine has not been reverse-engineered here). An UNVERIFIED entry
is a "go look", not a clean bill of health. Recording an absence of
investigation as a negative result is a mistake this workspace has made at
least four times.

Detection: Thumb `ldr rX,[pc,#imm]` puts its literal at ((pc+4) & ~3) + imm*4,
so the loads of a given pool word are found exactly rather than by proximity;
then a store THROUGH that register within the following instructions is a
write. Conservative: it reports WRITE only when it can see the store.
