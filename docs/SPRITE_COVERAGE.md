# Sprite/asset coverage — Phase 3 planning

Cross-referenced our 156-character roster (`tools/character_mode/characters.txt`) against the ROWE Character Mode project's already-built sprite report (`/home/jbfish00/Documents/Pokemon Rowe Alteration/tools/character_mode/sprite_report.txt`), since our Gen 1-8 roster is largely the same real-world characters ROWE already sourced donor art for.

## Coverage summary

| | count | % of 156 |
|---|---|---|
| Have an overworld sprite candidate | 97 | 62% |
| Have a trainer front-pic candidate | 69 | 44% |
| Have a battle back-pic candidate | 11 | 7% |
| Have AT LEAST ONE asset | 97 | 62% |
| Have NO assets in ROWE's tree | 59 | 38% |

## Pattern (matches plan expectations exactly)

The 59 characters with zero ROWE coverage are, without exception, Gen 6-8 (Kalos/Alola/Galar) roles plus a handful of Gen 1-5 anime-only characters (Ritchie, Tracey, Jessie, James, Lyra, Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip) that ROWE's own status notes already flagged as never sourced ("no GBA-style walking sheets exist publicly"). This is exactly the split the user already accepted when scoping this project: GBA-style pixel art genuinely doesn't exist anywhere (official or fan-made) for 3D-model-era (Gen 6-8) characters, so those get the lighter-weight trainer-card/menu-portrait-only treatment, not full OW+front+back sprites.

## What this means for Phase 3

- **97 characters (Gen 1-5 + a few Gen1 anime like Ash/Gary)**: candidate donor PNGs exist in ROWE's `graphics/trainers/front_pics/`, `graphics/trainers/back_pics/`, `graphics/object_events/` (303 front pics, 18 back pics, 1546 OW-related PNGs total in that tree, not all character-mode-specific — needs filtering). ROWE's sprite_report.txt gives *symbol names* (`OBJ_EVENT_GFX_CM_X`, `TRAINER_PIC_X`, `TRAINER_BACK_PIC_X`), not raw file paths — resolving symbol → exact PNG filename needs ROWE's `spritesheet_rules.mk`/`graphics_file_rules.mk` (not yet done; deferred until Phase 3 actually starts, since the real injection work is gated on Phase 1 anyway).
- **59 characters (Gen 6-8 + a few anime)**: no GBA-style art exists anywhere. Per user-confirmed policy: trainer-card/menu-select portrait only (widely available as fan-ripped icons for these game-original characters), generic/default costume fallback for their overworld appearance — no bespoke pixel art expected.
- Actually copying/injecting any of this is blocked on Phase 1 confirming: (a) Unbound's OW sprite table and trainer-pic table addresses, (b) whether Unbound uses standard GBA 4bpp+LZ77 compression for its custom sprite additions (open risk #7 in the plan, unconfirmed).

## Reuse mechanics (once unblocked)

Same credits-file discipline as ROWE (`CREDITS_CHARACTER_MODE.md` pattern) — a `CREDITS.md` will need the same donor list: pret/pokefirered, sinnoh-remakes/pokeemerald-platinum, PokemonHnS-Development/pokemonHnS, DiegoWT's Gen5-in-Gen4-style resource, StreakOfSprites' Ash sheet. Injection differs from ROWE's Makefile-automated pipeline: raw tile/palette data needs manual LZ77 compression and free-space injection with hand-patched pointers (see Phase 3 in the plan).

## 2026-07-23 — Ash Gray donor sourcing (anime-only gap partially closed)

Pokemon Ash Gray v4.5.3 (metapod23) was built locally — BPS patch (RAPatches
mirror) onto a byte-matching pret/pokefirered build — and its sprites ripped
(`RadicalRed-Character-Mode/tools/rip_frlg_sprites.py`). **19 anime-character
trainer front pics** now staged as verbatim LZ77 blobs in
`sprites/donors/ashgray/` (64x64 4bpp + 32 B palette — the same format this
engine family consumes; see that directory's README for provenance).

Coverage delta for the "never sourced" anime-only list: **Ritchie ✓,
Tracey ✓, Jessie ✓ + James ✓ (as a duo pic)** — plus new-to-us Duplica, Todd,
Giselle, A.J., Otoshi, Samurai, Damian, Gary, Cissy, Danny, Rudy, Jessiebelle,
and anime-style Brock/Misty/Oak/Giovanni alternates. Ash overworld
(walk/bike/fishing) + back-pic sheet also ripped.

**Still missing** (web-archive survey 2026-07-23 found no GBA-style front
pics): Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Lyra; Gen 6-9 policy unchanged
(portrait-only). Candidate OW-only source if ever needed: spherical-ice's
"Accurate FireRed Overworld Sprite Resource" (DeviantArt) — has some anime OW
sprites; The Spriters Resource search is JS-only (not scriptable).

**Pilot injection result (RadicalRed, 2026-07-23)**: all 19 donors injected
at 0x08CF0000 (15,364 B) by `tools/inject_sprites_pilot.py` (RR repo);
decode-back from the built ROM byte-exact; `gTrainerFrontPicTable`
consumption confirmed (12 literal-pool code refs incl. battle engine); the
all-slots test build boots to free-roam. The blob-copy + table-repoint
technique transfers to this project once its own table addresses are located.

### Outstanding (2026-07-24)

1. Confirm Unbound uses standard 4bpp+LZ77 trainer pics and locate its trainer-pic/OW tables
   (open risk #7 in this doc still stands; CFRU donor BPRE.ld candidates + XREF verification is
   the cheap first probe — that exact approach proved out on Radical Red).
2. Then reuse RadicalRed's pilot (`RadicalRed-Character-Mode/tools/inject_sprites_pilot.py`) —
   blob-copy + table-repoint, only addresses change.
3. Per-character wiring: natural surface is the number-entry select prompt (show mugshot at the
   "Play as {name}?" confirm).
4. Missing art: Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Lyra; James solo pic (duo-only).

## 2026-07-24 — CORRECTION: overworld coverage was undercounted (engine-native sprites)

Every previous coverage number in this file came from cross-referencing ROWE's
`sprite_report.txt`, which records only art ROWE had **staged for injection**.
That silently undercounts overworld sprites, because most of these characters are
NPCs in the games themselves — **this engine already ships their overworld
graphics**. Prof. Oak is the clearest case: the old survey listed him with no
overworld art at all, while both engine families define him
(`OBJ_EVENT_GFX_PROF_OAK` / `EVENT_OBJ_GFX_OAK`). Referencing an existing
graphics id is not an injection job.

Re-surveyed against CFRU (`tools/cfru_donor/include/constants/event_objects.h`, `EVENT_OBJ_GFX_*`):

**25 of this repo's 168 characters already have an overworld sprite in the
ROM** and need no art sourced:

Red, Leaf, Blue, Lance, Lorelei, Bruno, Agatha, Koga, Brock, Misty, Lt. Surge,
Erika, Sabrina, Blaine, Giovanni, Gary, Ethan, Lyra, Brendan, May, Lucas,
Dawn, Cynthia, Candice, Oak

Cross-repo, counting the engine tables adds **12 characters the old survey called
empty** — Lyra, Oak, Elm, Birch and eight Frontier Brains (Anabel, Tucker, Greta,
Spenser, Noland, Lucy, Brandon, Palmer) — and reclassifies **54 more** from "needs
injecting" to "already there".

Regenerate with `python3 RadicalRed-Character-Mode/tools/survey_engine_ow.py`
(canonical copy lives in the RR repo; it reads every sibling repo's live
`characters.txt`). Visual summary: the "Character Mode — Sprite Coverage by
Character" artifact.

### Three name collisions deliberately NOT counted

CFRU defines `MARLON`, `PENNY` and `MELONY`, but CFRU is Unbound's engine: its
Marlon is Unbound's own protagonist (`MARLON_PLAYER`, `YOUNG_MARLON`,
`MARLON_ARM`), and the engine has no Gen 9 content at all, so its `PENNY` cannot
be the Paldea character. Matching on name alone would have claimed art that does
not depict our character.

### Still open after this correction

1. **The Ash Gray overworld dump is 152 sprites and only 15 were ever
   identified** (`sprites/donors/ashgray/rip/ow/`). Ritchie and Tracey are both
   characters in Ash Gray, so their overworld sprites are very likely already in
   that dump — `ow014` and `ow015` (capless black-haired boys) are the leading
   candidates. Labelling the dump is the cheapest remaining win in Phase 3.
2. **No other anime-based hack has been sourced.** Ash Gray is the only one built
   locally. Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando and Trip have no art anywhere, and a hack
   covering the Johto/Hoenn/Sinnoh anime arcs is the only plausible source.
3. Back pics remain the real bottleneck: **13 characters across the whole
   workspace**, essentially playable protagonists only.
