# Sprite/asset coverage — Phase 3 planning

Cross-referenced our 156-character roster (`tools/character_mode/characters.txt`) against the ROWE Character Mode project's already-built sprite report (`/home/jbfish00/Documents/Pokemon Rowe Alteration/tools/character_mode/sprite_report.txt`), since our Gen 1-8 roster is largely the same real-world characters ROWE already sourced donor art for.

## Coverage summary

| | count | % of 156 |
|---|---|---|
| Have an overworld sprite candidate | 97 | 62% |
| Have a trainer front-pic candidate | 69 | 44% |
| Have a battle back-pic candidate | 11 | 7% |
| Have AT LEAST ONE asset | 97 | 62% |
| Have NO assets in ROWE's tree | 59 | 38% |

## Pattern (matches plan expectations exactly)

The 59 characters with zero ROWE coverage are, without exception, Gen 6-8 (Kalos/Alola/Galar) roles plus a handful of Gen 1-5 anime-only characters (Ritchie, Tracey, Jessie, James, Lyra, Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip) that ROWE's own status notes already flagged as never sourced ("no GBA-style walking sheets exist publicly"). This is exactly the split the user already accepted when scoping this project: GBA-style pixel art genuinely doesn't exist anywhere (official or fan-made) for 3D-model-era (Gen 6-8) characters, so those get the lighter-weight trainer-card/menu-portrait-only treatment, not full OW+front+back sprites.

## What this means for Phase 3

- **97 characters (Gen 1-5 + a few Gen1 anime like Ash/Gary)**: candidate donor PNGs exist in ROWE's `graphics/trainers/front_pics/`, `graphics/trainers/back_pics/`, `graphics/object_events/` (303 front pics, 18 back pics, 1546 OW-related PNGs total in that tree, not all character-mode-specific — needs filtering). ROWE's sprite_report.txt gives *symbol names* (`OBJ_EVENT_GFX_CM_X`, `TRAINER_PIC_X`, `TRAINER_BACK_PIC_X`), not raw file paths — resolving symbol → exact PNG filename needs ROWE's `spritesheet_rules.mk`/`graphics_file_rules.mk` (not yet done; deferred until Phase 3 actually starts, since the real injection work is gated on Phase 1 anyway).
- **59 characters (Gen 6-8 + a few anime)**: no GBA-style art exists anywhere. Per user-confirmed policy: trainer-card/menu-select portrait only (widely available as fan-ripped icons for these game-original characters), generic/default costume fallback for their overworld appearance — no bespoke pixel art expected.
- Actually copying/injecting any of this is blocked on Phase 1 confirming: (a) Unbound's OW sprite table and trainer-pic table addresses, (b) whether Unbound uses standard GBA 4bpp+LZ77 compression for its custom sprite additions (open risk #7 in the plan, unconfirmed).

## Reuse mechanics (once unblocked)

Same credits-file discipline as ROWE (`CREDITS_CHARACTER_MODE.md` pattern) — a `CREDITS.md` will need the same donor list: pret/pokefirered, sinnoh-remakes/pokeemerald-platinum, PokemonHnS-Development/pokemonHnS, DiegoWT's Gen5-in-Gen4-style resource, StreakOfSprites' Ash sheet. Injection differs from ROWE's Makefile-automated pipeline: raw tile/palette data needs manual LZ77 compression and free-space injection with hand-patched pointers (see Phase 3 in the plan).

## 2026-07-23 — Ash Gray donor sourcing (anime-only gap partially closed)

Pokemon Ash Gray v4.5.3 (metapod23) was built locally — BPS patch (RAPatches
mirror) onto a byte-matching pret/pokefirered build — and its sprites ripped
(`RadicalRed-Character-Mode/tools/rip_frlg_sprites.py`). **19 anime-character
trainer front pics** now staged as verbatim LZ77 blobs in
`sprites/donors/ashgray/` (64x64 4bpp + 32 B palette — the same format this
engine family consumes; see that directory's README for provenance).

Coverage delta for the "never sourced" anime-only list: **Ritchie ✓,
Tracey ✓, Jessie ✓ + James ✓ (as a duo pic)** — plus new-to-us Duplica, Todd,
Giselle, A.J., Otoshi, Samurai, Damian, Gary, Cissy, Danny, Rudy, Jessiebelle,
and anime-style Brock/Misty/Oak/Giovanni alternates. Ash overworld
(walk/bike/fishing) + back-pic sheet also ripped.

**Still missing** (web-archive survey 2026-07-23 found no GBA-style front
pics): Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Lyra; Gen 6-9 policy unchanged
(portrait-only). Candidate OW-only source if ever needed: spherical-ice's
"Accurate FireRed Overworld Sprite Resource" (DeviantArt) — has some anime OW
sprites; The Spriters Resource search is JS-only (not scriptable).

**Pilot injection result (RadicalRed, 2026-07-23)**: all 19 donors injected
at 0x08CF0000 (15,364 B) by `tools/inject_sprites_pilot.py` (RR repo);
decode-back from the built ROM byte-exact; `gTrainerFrontPicTable`
consumption confirmed (12 literal-pool code refs incl. battle engine); the
all-slots test build boots to free-roam. The blob-copy + table-repoint
technique transfers to this project once its own table addresses are located.

### Outstanding (2026-07-24)

1. Confirm Unbound uses standard 4bpp+LZ77 trainer pics and locate its trainer-pic/OW tables
   (open risk #7 in this doc still stands; CFRU donor BPRE.ld candidates + XREF verification is
   the cheap first probe — that exact approach proved out on Radical Red).
2. Then reuse RadicalRed's pilot (`RadicalRed-Character-Mode/tools/inject_sprites_pilot.py`) —
   blob-copy + table-repoint, only addresses change.
3. Per-character wiring: natural surface is the number-entry select prompt (show mugshot at the
   "Play as {name}?" confirm).
4. Missing art: Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Lyra; James solo pic (duo-only).

## 2026-07-24 — CORRECTION: overworld coverage was undercounted (engine-native sprites)

Every previous coverage number in this file came from cross-referencing ROWE's
`sprite_report.txt`, which records only art ROWE had **staged for injection**.
That silently undercounts overworld sprites, because most of these characters are
NPCs in the games themselves — **this engine already ships their overworld
graphics**. Prof. Oak is the clearest case: the old survey listed him with no
overworld art at all, while both engine families define him
(`OBJ_EVENT_GFX_PROF_OAK` / `EVENT_OBJ_GFX_OAK`). Referencing an existing
graphics id is not an injection job.

Re-surveyed against CFRU (`tools/cfru_donor/include/constants/event_objects.h`, `EVENT_OBJ_GFX_*`):

**25 of this repo's 168 characters already have an overworld sprite in the
ROM** and need no art sourced:

Red, Leaf, Blue, Lance, Lorelei, Bruno, Agatha, Koga, Brock, Misty, Lt. Surge,
Erika, Sabrina, Blaine, Giovanni, Gary, Ethan, Lyra, Brendan, May, Lucas,
Dawn, Cynthia, Candice, Oak

Cross-repo, counting the engine tables adds **12 characters the old survey called
empty** — Lyra, Oak, Elm, Birch and eight Frontier Brains (Anabel, Tucker, Greta,
Spenser, Noland, Lucy, Brandon, Palmer) — and reclassifies **54 more** from "needs
injecting" to "already there".

Regenerate with `python3 RadicalRed-Character-Mode/tools/survey_engine_ow.py`
(canonical copy lives in the RR repo; it reads every sibling repo's live
`characters.txt`). Visual summary: the "Character Mode — Sprite Coverage by
Character" artifact.

### Three name collisions deliberately NOT counted

CFRU defines `MARLON`, `PENNY` and `MELONY`, but CFRU is Unbound's engine: its
Marlon is Unbound's own protagonist (`MARLON_PLAYER`, `YOUNG_MARLON`,
`MARLON_ARM`), and the engine has no Gen 9 content at all, so its `PENNY` cannot
be the Paldea character. Matching on name alone would have claimed art that does
not depict our character.

### Still open after this correction

1. **The Ash Gray overworld dump is 152 sprites and only 15 were ever
   identified** (`sprites/donors/ashgray/rip/ow/`). Ritchie and Tracey are both
   characters in Ash Gray, so their overworld sprites are very likely already in
   that dump — `ow014` and `ow015` (capless black-haired boys) are the leading
   candidates. Labelling the dump is the cheapest remaining win in Phase 3.
2. **No other anime-based hack has been sourced.** Ash Gray is the only one built
   locally. Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando and Trip have no art anywhere, and a hack
   covering the Johto/Hoenn/Sinnoh anime arcs is the only plausible source.
3. Back pics remain the real bottleneck: **13 characters across the whole
   workspace**, essentially playable protagonists only.


## 2026-07-25 — CORRECTION 2: "no GBA-style art exists for 3D-era characters" is FALSE

The claim stated above (and in every sibling repo's copy of this file) that GBA-style pixel art
"genuinely doesn't exist anywhere (official or fan-made) for 3D-model-era characters" is **wrong**.
A five-agent search of fan-games and ROM hacks found it, and the format was verified by measuring
pixels rather than trusting page descriptions.

### Primary source: Pokémon Emerald Rogue (open source, drop-in format)

`https://github.com/Pokabbie/pokeemerald-rogue` (branch `vanilla`) — a pret/pokeemerald decomp fork.
Its `graphics/trainers/front_pics/` is split into `kalos/` (13), `alola/` (14), `galar/` (11),
`paldea/` (12) and `rival/` (Gen 6-9 subset), plus Gen 1-5 casts. **Format verified locally: every
sampled front pic is 64x64, 4-bit colormap, exactly 16 palette entries** — stock pokeemerald format,
zero conversion. Back pics are 64x320 5-frame sheets; overworld sets are 144x32 (9 x 16x32 frames).

Cross-matched against this repo's live `characters.txt`: **63 of its characters gain a
trainer front pic they did not have**:

Lyra, Silver, Aaron, Flint, Alder, Iris, Shauntal, Marshal, Grimsley, Caitlin,
Cilan, Chili, Cress, Lenora, Burgh, Elesa, Clay, Skyla, Brycen, Drayden,
Cheren, Roxie, Marlon, Bianca, Hugh, N, Diantha, Malva, Siebold, Wikstrom,
Drasna, Viola, Grant, Korrina, Ramos, Clemont, Valerie, Olympia, Wulfric,
Shauna, Lysandre, Kukui, Hau, Molayne, Kahili, Acerola, Olivia, Gladion,
Sophocles, Leon, Milo, Nessa, Kabu, Bea, Allister, Opal, Gordie, Melony,
Piers, Raihan, Hop, Bede, Marnie

Workspace-wide the search takes trainer-pic coverage from 76 to 165 of 236 characters, and the
"nothing at all" group from 92 down to 31.

**Cost: attribution.** The repo has no LICENSE and no CREDITS.md. The only credit trail is its
in-game credits roll (`src/data/credits.h`), which lists ~46 artists under "Additional Sprites"
without saying who drew what — so we can credit the project and that roll, but not per sprite.
Several of those names (Beliot419, princess-phoenix, Zender1752, SageDeoxys) are the same DeviantArt
spriters other searches found independently: the repo is best understood as a pre-converted
aggregation of those galleries.

### Secondary sources worth knowing

- **SwSh Ultimate Plus** (PCL.G -> Jeanstars -> Phantonomy; FireRed + CFRU, BPS-distributed) — the
  "Sword and Shield GBA hack". Real, and our Ash Gray rip recipe would apply unchanged. **Rejected as
  primary**: its own README says *"As a non-original dev, I'm not certain where all of the assets
  came from"*, with exactly one Gen 8 sprite attributed. Correct format, unattributable provenance.
- **darklight177 + RHcks Paldea sheet** (DeviantArt) — 8 Paldea leaders + Geeta, trainer pics AND
  overworld strips, measured GBA-native. Free to use, credit RHcks. Adds overworld art Rogue lacks.
- **RichardPT** (DeviantArt) — the only Alain art anywhere: a complete Gen 3 engine set (front, back,
  walking, running, surfing, fishing, town map, VS Seeker). Free with credit.
- **Kalarie's anime overworlds**, PokéCommunity thread 407124 — includes **Paul**, one of the six
  anime characters previously believed to have no art anywhere. Free with credit; needs a dynamic
  overworld palette patch. NOT yet retrieved or verified.
- **Droid779** (Eevee Expo 284) — Gen III-style overworlds for Mallow, Kiawe, Gladion; author takes
  requests.
- **Beliot419 / mid117 / Zender1752** — broad Gen 7-9 coverage including Sada, Turo, Penny and Arven,
  but DS/Gen 5 style at 80x80. Reference for a redraw, not a drop-in.

### Rejected on measurement (do not re-chase)

- mid117's Scarlet/Violet set: DS/Gen 5 style, not GBA.
- xDracolich's Nemona overworld: genuine Gen 3 art but Essentials scale (30x40 per frame vs GBA's
  16x32).
- PokéCommunity 339994: the Gen 6 block is a to-do list with zero image links.
- PokéCommunity 316888 "Kalos Sprites for GBA": Pokémon species only, and every image is a TinyPic
  link — that domain no longer resolves.
- spherical-ice's "Accurate FireRed Overworld Sprite Resource", referenced in our docs for a year:
  Gen 3 trainer *classes* only, nothing past Gen 3.
- Upstream `rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`: ships no Gen 6-9 human character art at all. Adding
  Gen 9 *species* is not the same as adding Gen 9 *humans* — this distinction is the easiest way to
  get a wrong answer here.

### Still unresolved

1. **26 of this repo's characters still have no art of any kind.** Workspace-wide the 31 are
   the anime cast (Drew, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Alain, Sawyer, Tobias, Goh, Chloe, the Alola anime
   four), the professors (Rowan, Juniper, Sycamore, Burnet, Samson Oak, Magnolia, Sonia, Laventon,
   Cerise, Sada, Turo), and Guzma, Plumeria, Lusamine, Rose, Dahlia, Darach.
2. **The anime-arc search never finished** — that agent hit a usage limit having just surfaced a
   Pokesho 64x64 GBA trainer gallery described as free material. Unverified lead, not a finding.
   The "is there an Ash Gray equivalent for the Hoenn/Sinnoh/Unova arcs" question is still open.
3. **The Ash Gray overworld dump is still unlabelled**: 152 sprites, 15 identified. Ritchie and
   Tracey are both in that game so their overworld art is very likely already ripped —
   `ow014`/`ow015` are the candidates. Confirmed so far: `ow050` Jessie, `ow051`/`ow052` James,
   `ow064` Nurse Joy.
4. **Nothing has been staged or injected.** This is a sourcing finding only; `sprite_asset_id` is
   still `0xFFFF` everywhere.


## 2026-07-25 — CORRECTION 3: the "never sourced" anime characters were sourced all along

Correction 2 closed the Gen 6-9 gap. This closes the anime gap that predates it. The list
"Drew, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Trip, Lyra — no GBA-style art exists anywhere" has been carried in this
file since 2026-07-23. **Five of the six exist.** Only Trip is genuinely missing.

### Pokesho (ポケしょ), by ポケモア / Pokemore — the find

A Japanese fan site that ran two galleries built explicitly to GBA spec. Not a game: a pure sprite
resource. **Both galleries are retired from the live site**; everything below came from the Wayback
capture of **2018-08-15** and was downloaded and format-verified locally.

- **Trainer gallery** (`dot_battle.html`, 68 sprites) — **64x64, <=16 colours = exact GBA trainer
  front-pic format.** Verified: `b_shuu`/`b_shuu2` = **Drew** (two poses), `b_masato` = Max,
  `b_rokettodan` = the Jessie+Meowth+James trio, plus Harley, Tyson, Robert, anime May, Dawn, and
  Ash/Brock/Misty in Kanto, Hoenn and Sinnoh outfits. Measured 64x64 / 16-colour on every sample.
- **Field gallery** (`dot_field.html`, 302 sprites) — **16x22, 16 colours, FRLG-spec, FRONT-FACING
  FRAME ONLY.** Verified: `f_shinji` = **Paul**, `f_nozomi` = **Zoey**, `f_naoshi` = **Nando**
  (carrying his harp), `f_shuu` = Drew, `f_kojirou` = **solo James**, `f_onnanoko_hgss` = **Lyra**.
  Also Ritchie, Tracey, Reggie, Kenny, Ursula, Morrison, Iris, Cilan, Bianca, Cheren, N.
- **Licence, quoted from the gallery header:** 「GBA風トレーナードット絵を展示しています。
  **フリー素材になります**。」 ("GBA-style trainer pixel art is exhibited here. **These are free
  materials.**") and 「すべて64×64サイズ。透明色合わせて最大16色です。**素材としての使用も可能です**。」
  The still-live FAQ answers 「素材もらってもいいですか！？」 with 「**どうぞどうぞ！！**」
  ("Please, go right ahead!!"). Credit as 「ポケしょ / Pokesho（ポケモア）」.
- **Two real caveats.** (1) The field sprites are ONE FRAME — side and back must be drawn before
  they are usable as walking sprites. (2) The galleries are retired and the author states he deletes
  work he considers lower quality; permission was granted while published, so reusing archived
  copies is a judgement call, not a settled one.

### Supporting anime sources

- **kalarie, PokéCommunity thread 407124** — 73 anime overworld sheets, **all imgur links still
  live**, verified **144x32 = the standard FireRed 9-frame NPC sheet of 16x32 frames, GBA-native
  drop-in**. Has **solo James and solo Jessie**, plus Meowth, Butch, Cassidy, Jenny, Joy, Brock,
  Misty, Oak. Kanto/Orange era only. Licence: *"You're free to use any of these sprites in your
  hack... Be sure to give proper credit though."* Needs Navenatox's Dynamic Overworld Palettes patch.
  **This resource is literally Pokesho's front frames animated into full sheets** (its credits say
  so) — which is the proof-of-workflow for doing the same to Paul, Zoey and Nando.
- **aveontrainer (DeviantArt)** — ~480 deviations; posted at 128x192 but that is a clean 2x upscale
  of a native **64x96 = 16 frames of 16x24**, i.e. a full four-direction walk cycle. Has Drew, Lyra,
  Ritchie, Harley, Morrison, **Alain**, Serena, Iris, Bianca, Dawn, Barry, Clemont. No blanket
  licence; takes overworld commissions — the realistic route for Trip/Zoey/Nando walk cycles.
- **Team Aqua's Asset Repo** (`github.com/TeamAquasHideout/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo`) — **the cleanest
  licence found anywhere**: *"All assets are both free to use and edit by default, but if any assets
  specifically mention not being free to edit, please respect the author's wishes."* Coverage of our
  roster is thin (Lyra, Iris, Serena/Calem, Dawn, Barry + kalarie's Kanto anime fronts) but prefer it
  wherever it overlaps another source.

### CORRECTION to Correction 2: Paul is NOT in kalarie's resource

Correction 2 recorded Paul as available from PokéCommunity 407124. That was wrong. Paul appears in
that thread only as a **rejected submission** (post #20 by *etique*) — the maintainer turned it down
as *"not really FR Style"* — and the attachment measures 32x48 DS-format frames, not GBA. **Paul's
real source is Pokesho's `f_shinji`.**

### The anime-arc hack question: evidenced NEGATIVE

There is **no GBA anime-arc ROM hack for Sinnoh or Unova**, in existence or in development.
*Advanced Generation* (Hoenn, Emerald) stalled at "Beta One Progress: 30%" and its thread is locked.
*Ash Hoenn Version* claims completion but ships as a **pre-patched .gba only**, which fails our
patch-only rule. *Johto League Showdown* is likewise pre-patched-only. *Ash Z* is a 3DS hack with 3D
models. The Sinnoh/Unova cast art exists as standalone resources, not inside any game.
**Pokémon Fire Ash** (RPG Maker XP + Essentials, PC) is the only known thing containing **Trip** —
its walkthrough confirms Trip, Sawyer, Tobias, Paul, Nando and Zoey as battleable trainers — but it
is not a ROM hack, has no stated asset licence, and **nobody has opened its `Graphics/Trainers`
folder to confirm the sprite format.**

### Where this repo now stands

**23 of its characters still have no art of any kind.** Workspace-wide the remaining 26 are
the eleven professors (Rowan, Juniper, Sycamore, Burnet, Samson Oak, Magnolia, Sonia, Laventon,
Cerise, Sada, Turo), the Alola anime four (Lillie, Kiawe, Lana, Mallow), Guzma, Plumeria, Lusamine,
Rose, Goh, Chloe, Tobias, Sawyer, **Trip**, Dahlia and Darach. Several of the artists found here take
commissions and already work natively in our format.

Workspace totals across the three corrections: overworld 103 -> 131 (plus 31 partial), trainer pics
76 -> 168, back pics 13 -> 18, "nothing at all" 92 -> 26.

Nothing is staged or injected. `sprite_asset_id` is still `0xFFFF` everywhere.


## 2026-07-25 — CORRECTION 4: front and back pics were undercounted too (Frontier Brains, Oak, Blue)

Correction 1 found that **overworld** art was undercounted because the surveys were built from
ROWE's `sprite_report.txt`, which records only art ROWE had *staged for injection*. The same bug
applies to **trainer front pics and back pics**, and it bites hardest for characters added to the
roster after that report was written.

**The Frontier Brains are the clearest case.** All seven Hoenn Brains are battleable trainers in
vanilla Emerald, so `TRAINER_PIC_SALON_MAIDEN_ANABEL`, `DOME_ACE_TUCKER`, `ARENA_TYCOON_GRETA`,
`PALACE_MAVEN_SPENSER`, `FACTORY_HEAD_NOLAND`, `PIKE_QUEEN_LUCY` and `PYRAMID_KING_BRANDON` have
always existed, with real PNGs in the donor tree. Palmer has `TRAINER_PIC_PALMER` in CFRU. They were
recorded as "no art" purely because they joined the roster on 2026-07-24, long after ROWE's survey.
**Anabel, Tucker, Greta, Spenser, Noland, Lucy, Brandon and Palmer all go from 1/3 to 2/3.**
Dahlia and Darach stay at zero — Sinnoh-only Brains, no GBA-era art.

**Two more found the same way, both verified by measuring the files:**
- **Prof. Oak has a front pic in the ROM.** `TRAINER_PIC_PROF_OAK 0x84` in CFRU (so Radical Red and
  Unbound can reference it with no injection at all), and `professor_oak_frlg.png` — 64x64,
  16-colour, verified — in the pokeemerald-expansion tree for Seaglass and Lazarus.
- **`TRAINER_BACK_PIC_RIVAL` is Blue/Gary's back sprite**, sitting unused in CFRU. Engine back
  sprites really are protagonist-only otherwise, which is why this is the sole addition.

### New tool: `tools/survey_engine_assets.py`

Supersedes `survey_engine_ow.py`. Matches every character in every repo's live `characters.txt`
against the CFRU / pokeemerald-expansion / pokecrystal tables for **all three** sprite types, and
strips trainer-class prefixes (`SALON_MAIDEN_`, `LEADER_`, `ELITE_FOUR_`…) so a character matches its
own pic regardless of title. For this repo it reports **ow 26, front 35, back 10**.

Two traps encoded in it, both of which produced wrong answers before being fixed:
1. **pokeemerald keeps back-pic symbols in `src/data/graphics/trainers.h`, not in
   `include/constants/trainers.h`** where the front pics live. Reading the wrong file silently
   reports zero back pics for both Emerald repos.
2. **Those symbols are CamelCase** (`gTrainerBackPic_Brendan`), unlike every other table. An
   uppercase-only capture matches just the leading letter, so `gTrainerBackPic_None` yields `N` —
   which falsely handed a back sprite to the character **N**. Normalise CamelCase before matching.

Known blind spot, documented in the file: an asset that ships as **art but is not wired to a trainer
slot** has no constant to match. That is exactly how `professor_oak_frlg.png` hid on the Emerald
side — the PNG is right there, but no `TRAINER_PIC_*OAK*` constant exists in that donor. When a
character seems to have nothing, check the graphics directories as well as the constants.

### Professors — a structural answer, not just a gap

Professors don't battle, so **front pics were never drawn for them**. That single fact explains the
whole professor gap and is worth remembering before any future search. Exceptions found:
- **Oak** — front pic in-engine (above); for Prism, `pret/pokecrystal/gfx/trainers/oak.png` is
  56x56 4-colour, native Gen 2 format and a direct drop-in.
- **Birch** — `graphics/birch_speech/birch.png` is 64x64 / 16-colour (verified) but is *intro*
  art, not a front-pic table entry; check the palette convention before injecting.
- **Rowan** — `Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo` → `Overworld Trainer Sprites/spilledpizza/.../DP_prof_rowan.png`,
  verified **144x32, 16-colour, with matching .pal**. Clean drop-in under that repo's
  "free to use and edit by default" licence.
- Zero professor front or back pics exist across all 18,299 files of the Team Aqua repo, and GitHub
  code search returns nothing for `TRAINER_PIC_ROWAN`/`JUNIPER`/`SYCAMORE`/`LAVENTON`/`MAGNOLIA`/
  `SONIA`. `OBJ_EVENT_GFX_PROF_ROWAN` has 83 hits but all are `pokeplatinum` — DS assets, a redraw.

**Licence traps flagged:** the only Oak back pic found (Boonzeet, DeviantArt) is **CC BY-NC-ND**, and
ND forbids exactly the 512x192 -> 64x320 re-layout it would need. Wolfang62's professor set gates the
four most wanted: *"Please do not use them (Sycamore, Magnolia, Sonia and Laventon) without my
permission."* aveontrainer has FRLG-style professor overworlds but states no terms at all.

### Where this repo stands

**22 of its characters have no art of any kind.** Workspace-wide: overworld 132 (+31 partial),
front pics 177, back pics 20, complete sets 20, nothing-at-all **25**.

### Search left unfinished — spend limit, not exhaustion

The last round stopped on an account spend limit with three threads mid-verification. Recorded as
**unverified leads, not findings**: a claimed **Lance back sprite**; a **pokefirered fork said to
carry Volo trainer front pics** (Volo is not currently in any roster — a roster decision, not just a
sprite one); and a DeviantArt spriter with 240+ deviations not yet enumerated. Anyone resuming should
start there.

Nothing is staged or injected. `sprite_asset_id` is still `0xFFFF` everywhere.


## 2026-07-25 — CORRECTION 5: back sprites found, and the "mugshot" is not a new asset class

### Lance is the first non-protagonist with a GBA back sprite

Two independent sheets, both downloaded and measured:
- `TeamAquasHideout/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo` -> `Trainer Back Sprites/yoshord/lance_(lets_go).png`
  — **64x384, indexed, 16 colours = SIX 64x64 frames** (Let's Go design). yoshord's README ships the
  matching `sAnimCmd_Lance_Back[]` array, and notes you can instead drop frame 1 or 2 and reuse the
  Red/Leaf `AnimCmd`. Repo licence: *"free to use and edit by default... provided they are submitted
  alongside credit to their original creator."* Credit yoshord.
- `ShinyDragonHunter/pokefirereddx-old` -> `graphics/trainers/back_pics/lance_back_pic.png`
  — **64x256, 4 frames** (HGSS design, visually distinct). No LICENSE; credit ShinyDragonHunter.

**Blue/Gary now has three sources**: the engine's own `TRAINER_BACK_PIC_RIVAL` (Correction 4),
TAAR's `ShinyDragonHunter/rival.png` (**64x320, 16c, verified**), and LouLilie's FRLG Rival Green
sheet (**64x320, 16c**, extracted from a pixel-perfect 2x upscale; *"Feel free to use in your
projects with credit!"*).

### Three back sprites exist but are LICENCE-GATED — Gladion, Lucy, Lillie

All three are in `Enhanced-Projects/Emerald-Enhanced` and all three measure clean
(Gladion 64x384, Lucy and Lillie 64x256, 16 colours, verified by download). **Do not use them
yet.** Its README: *"Emerald Enhanced is NOT free to clone and redistribute... If you intend to use
Art from this project, you must obtain permission from an executive of Enhanced Projects."* They
state they rarely decline. Nobody has asked. These are recorded as gated, NOT as held.

### Hard negative on the rest

Authenticated GitHub code search, 38+ queries across all public code, returned **zero** results for
back sprites of **Cynthia, Silver, Misty, Brock, Cyrus, Leon, Colress, Ghetsis and Prof. Oak** —
under both the `TRAINER_BACK_PIC_*` and `gTrainerBackPic_*` spellings and by asset path. Bulbagarden
confirms official non-protagonist backs exist only at DS resolution (HGSS Lance and Silver). The
structural reason: **GBA back sprites were only ever drawn for characters the player controls.**

Method note worth keeping: `TRAINER_BACK_PIC_LANCE` returns zero hits — pokefirereddx spells it
`gTrainerBackPic_Lance`. Constant-name searches alone would have missed the only Lance sheet that
exists; the path-string queries are what found it.

### The CFRU "mugshot" is a trainer front pic, not a new format

`Mugshot_DP_Tabled_Sprite_VS_Symbol` is not an asset class — it is a concatenation of three
pre-battle-transition settings (DP-style bars, sprite-from-table flag, VS symbol on the player side).
The sprite it loads is **64x64, 4bpp, <=16 colours, LZ77-compressed, size = 64*64/2 = 2048** — the
exact format we already inject — indexed by *trainer front-pic id*. `sPreBattleMugshotSprites` ships
empty in every public CFRU fork (checked in nine).

Consequences:
- Only **two** community mugshots exist anywhere: a genuine Cynthia (`spilledpizza/DP_cynthia_mugshot.png`,
  64x64 14c) and an Archie (`Phantomony/archie_mugshot.png`), both in Team Aqua's repo. A third pair
  labelled `brendan_mugshot`/`may_mugshot` there is **mislabelled** — viewing them shows Minish-Cap
  style art of neither character.
- ROWE's tree already holds **46 pre-built `cm_*.4bpp.lz` blobs at exactly 2048 bytes uncompressed**
  — literally the value CFRU's `MugshotTable.size` field wants. Drop-in today.
- Two constraints: the table is hard-sized `[147]` and gated on `trainerPicId < 147`, which RR and
  Unbound both exceed; and its enabling flag is **0x924**, inside the daily-swept 0x920-0x95F range
  that already caused the Character Mode flag bug on the Emerald hacks.

### ⚠️ Closes an outstanding item, and contradicts a recorded doubt

`gTrainerFrontPicTable` = **0x0823957C** and `gTrainerFrontPicPaletteTable` = **0x08239A1C** were
verified valid in **both shipped ROMs** (Radical Red 4.1 and Unbound v2.1.1.1) by locating CFRU's
`VS_Sprite` blob in each, dumping the referencing literal pools, and decoding real sprites back out.

- This **closes Unbound's outstanding item #1** ("locate its trainer-pic tables").
- It **contradicts the doubt recorded in RR's own notes** that there was "no guarantee Radical Red's
  actual compiled binary has this table at the same address". It does.
- Radical Red already contains the Kanto cast at vanilla FRLG indices (Blue 0x6A, Lance 0x73,
  Brock 0x74, Misty 0x75, Oak 0x84, May 0x86, Sabrina 0x7A, Giovanni 0x6C — all decoded and viewed).
  **Unbound has remapped these indices** and needs its own survey.

### ⚠️ Unresolved contradiction — RichardPT's Alain

One search reported RichardPT's Alain as a complete GBA-native engine set. A later one measured the
same artist's Gladion — same Derlo lineage — at **32x44 overworld and 50x114 front pic**, i.e.
DS/Essentials proportions, and expects Alain to match. **Nobody has measured the Alain files
directly.** Alain is currently counted as fully covered in the matrix; treat that row as unconfirmed
until someone downloads and measures it.

### Totals

overworld 132 (+31 partial), front pics 177, back pics **21** (+3 licence-gated),
complete sets 21, nothing at all **24**.

Nothing is staged or injected. `sprite_asset_id` is still `0xFFFF` everywhere.


## 2026-07-25 — PHASE 3 WIRED (Radical Red): 164 sprites injected, sprite_asset_id is real

`sprite_asset_id` was `0xFFFF` in every record from the start of this project — a placeholder for
art that did not exist. It exists now (754 sprites staged under `sprites/donors/`), so Radical Red
is wired.

### How, and why it is engine-agnostic

- `tools/character_mode/emit_sprite_table.py` picks ONE front pic per character from the staged
  donors and emits `cm_sprite_blobs.bin` (146,896 B of LZ77 gfx+palette) and
  `cm_sprite_offsets.bin` (210 x {u32 gfx_off, u32 pal_off}).
- `tools/inject_character_mode.py` places both and builds an absolute-pointer table in ROM.
- `characters.bin`'s `sprite_asset_id` is set for **164 of 210** characters; the other 46 keep
  `0xFFFF` and get a null table entry.

**⭐ This never touches `gTrainerFrontPicTable`.** The table is additive, so nothing the game already
draws changes — no risk of swapping a real opponent's art mid-playthrough. **That also means the
"trainer-pic tables not located" blocker recorded for Seaglass and Lazarus does not apply to this
approach.** Those repos can be wired the same way without locating anything: the requirement is free
space and a pointer table, not an engine table. This is the cheapest remaining Phase 3 step.

### Source preference (rationale, not taste)

`ashgray` (verbatim ROM-format LZ, anime art unavailable elsewhere) → `rogue` (148 of the 164; one
consistent style across Gen 1-9) → `taar` (per-author attribution recoverable) → `hns` → `pokesho`
→ `platinum` **last, because no per-sprite credit exists for it**.

### Placement — the first build attempt failed, correctly

The 0x08B71D04 block holding the shim/bitmaps/scripts/wild-data had only ~65 KB left below
0x08D00000, and the blobs are ~147 KB. The injector's own 0xFF precondition check refused rather
than silently overwriting content. Moved to the separate **713 KB 0xFF run at 0x08951E14**:
`CM_SPRITE_PTRS_ADDR = 0x08952000`, `CM_SPRITE_BLOBS_ADDR = 0x08952800`.

### Verification — correctness, not just "these bytes may differ"

`verify_artifacts.py` section 9 checks that blobs match the artifact, that the pointer table matches
an independent recomputation, that **every one of the 164 pointers lands inside the blob region and
decodes to exactly 2048 B of graphics + 32 B of palette**, and that `characters.bin` agrees with the
in-ROM table about who has art. The LZ77 decoder is written out longhand in the test rather than
imported from `png_to_gba.py`, **so a bug in the converter cannot verify its own output.**

All layers green: verify_artifacts ALL PASS, boot smoke 4/4, audit_conflicts 9/9, shim unit 9/9.
BPS 36 KB → 172 KB (the art).

### What this does NOT do

**Nothing renders yet.** Radical Red's trainer card and new-game intro do not read
`gTrainerFrontPicTable` (customization system / dedicated BG tiles), so a UI surface still has to be
chosen — the natural one is a mugshot at the character-select confirm. The data path is complete and
verified up to that point, and no other repo is wired yet.

### Not injected (46 of 210)

Ash, Kris, Tate, Maxie, Archie, Paul, Zoey, Nando, Ghetsis, Colress, Trip, Alain and 34 more —
mostly characters where only overworld art was found, plus Volo (Legends: Arceus, absent from every
donor set). Several of these have staged overworld sheets and simply lack a front pic.


## 2026-07-25 — sprite work now has a runbook

Per-repo sprite notes stay here, but the cross-cutting state, open-work priority
order, commands, traps and attribution obligations live in **`SPRITE_PLAN.md` at the
workspace root** (`/home/jbfish00/Documents/Character Hacks/SPRITE_PLAN.md`).
Read that first when picking up sprite work in a fresh session; it is to sprites what
`CHARACTER_ROSTER_PLAN.md` is to rosters.
